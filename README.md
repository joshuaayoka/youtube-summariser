YT Summariser is a web application made with React and Node.js that generates summaries of YouTube videos and documents.
The application allows users to input a YouTube video URL or upload a document, and then provides an AI-created summary. 
The project is designed to help users quickly extract key information from videos or text documents without needing to watch a full video or read through a full document.
